abstract: One deadly aspect of COVID-19 is that those infected can often be contagious
  before exhibiting overt symptoms. While methods such as temperature checks and sinus
  swabs have aided with early detection, the former does not always provide a reliable
  indicator of COVID-19, and the latter is invasive and requires significant human
  and material resources to administer. This paper presents a non-invasive COVID-19
  early screening system implementable with commercial off-the-shelf WiFi devices.
  The system leverages the Doppler radar principle to monitor respiratory-related
  chest motions and identify breathing rates that indicate COVID-19 infection. We
  developed the prototype with software-defined Wi-Fi radios, and evaluated the system
  performance with a robotic mover simulating human breathing, and on actual breathing,
  with a consistent respiratory rate accuracy better than one breath per minute, exceeding
  that for common medical practices.
